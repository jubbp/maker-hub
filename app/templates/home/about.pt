            <p><h1>Maker Hub: About</h1></p>
            
<p>
Maker-Hub is a personal Electronics Parts Management System that integrates with KiCAD and LCSC, an Asian parts distributor.  It was designed for virtually no limits on the number of parts, projects or storage locations.  It's meant to be easy and quick to install and  get up and running <i>[on a Raspberry Pi]</i>.<br> 
</p>

<p>
Installation management is based around the Poetry system, which will handle installing all the Python 3.9 
packages needed to run the system.  See the:  <i>pyproject.toml</i> file for a full list of these dependancies.
